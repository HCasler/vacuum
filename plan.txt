For integration tests:

Need a "test" option for sys_args
	this needs to create new, fake ports, from which Python can read (maybe a file or a fifo?)
		implementation of serial class that does what we want for the tests?

Need files of test data from the fake hardware

need a file that calls the main program with the test option, reads in the fake data, checks that the output is correct





For unit tests:

Need the stuff for integration tests

Need to re-organize code so it can be unit tested (good ol' if __name__ == '__main__')

need files containing unit tests
